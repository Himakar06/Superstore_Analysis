# 🛒 Superstore Sales Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts sales patterns using the Superstore dataset. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and business insights.

## 📌 Business Problem
Identify the key factors affecting profit and sales across regions, categories, and customer segments. Improve profitability with better decision-making.

## 📊 Insights from EDA
- High discounts lead to loss in profit
- Certain regions consistently underperform
- Categories like Office Supplies have thin margins

## 🤖 ML Results
Used regression models to predict profit:
- Best Model: Random Forest Regressor (R² = 0.82)

## ✅ Recommendations
- Reduce discounting in the Technology category
- Focus on the West region for growth
- Improve delivery speed to boost customer satisfaction

## 🚀 Future Work
- Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)
- Develop a churn prediction model
